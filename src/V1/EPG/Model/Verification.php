 * Elavon Payment Gateway API
 *
 * Elavon Payment Gateway helpdesk [https://developer.elavon.com/products/elavon-payment-gateway/v1/](https://developer.elavon.com/products/elavon-payment-gateway/v1/overview#support) # Overview  This HTTP REST API is available for developers integrating with Elavon Payment Gateway for eCommerce.  The Elavon Payment Gateway API follows standard HTTP authentication and response codes and you can use it with most HTTP clients.  The Elavon Payment Gateway API tries to be precise with its responses but lenient with its requests. Elavon Payment Gateway defaults to case insensitivity where case is irrelevant and will use coercion to try resolving unexpected types.  The system only accepts JSON request bodies and returns UTF-8 encoded JSON response bodies pretty-printed for readability and with most fields included for discoverability.  The system supports HATEOAS and provides references between resources as hypermedia links. If needed, the system can accept resource IDs in requests instead.  We take security seriously. Communication with Elavon Payment Gateway must be over secure HTTP using at least TLS 1.2. Elavon Payment Gateway suppresses sensitive fields on responses.  PCI compliance is vital, and Elavon Payment Gateway provides options that allow integrators to reduce their own PCI scope.  ## Example Code  The Elavon Payment Gateway API Reference uses REST API over HTTP. To receive example code, contact the [EPG helpdesk](https://developer.elavon.com/products/elavon-payment-gateway/v1overview#support) for further assistance.  Examples are available for the following:  * C# * Java * Node.js * PHP * Python * Ruby * VB Webforms  ## Credentials  To get a user ID and password, integrators must send a primary email. Elavon sends an email that contains a link to the merchant UI as well as instructions on how to establish a password.  At the moment, Elavon onboards integrators into the Elavon Payment Gateway system manually, but the team is working on making this a more automated process in a future release.  ## Authentication  Elavon Payment Gateway's API authenticates using the HTTP BASIC method over secure HTTP using at least Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2.  Integrators receive a pair of API keys: one public and one secret. Elavon manages and provides API keys - future updates will add self-management as an option.  It's safe to include your public key in client-side code. Only [hosted card](#tag/Hosted-Cards) resource operations authenticate using the public API key. Note that some fields will be suppressed when using a public API key. Check the [hosted card resource](#tag/Hosted-Cards) for details. Their format, when used in actual scenarios, start with 'pk_'. Example:  ``` pk_Yp6XYXCwkYjWFj9ByrhbDQD3 ```  Never expose your secret key in client-side code. Only include your secret key in requests sent from a secure server. The API accepts the secret key for all requests. Their format, when used in actual scenarios, start with 'sk_'. Example:  ``` sk_GWhvCdXCx6FWYhDqCRWVwtRk ```  Elavon provides integrators with a unique merchant alias for each merchant they're acting on behalf of.  ## Errors  Error responses generally have a standard JSON response. A failures array provides more information to help the integrator diagnose the issue.  4xx status codes show a problem with the request. Avoid retrying the request before addressing the problem. The following table shows some common failure codes and the causes that prompts them.  | Failure Code         | Status Code | Failure Description | |----------------------|-------------|---------------------| | badRequest           | 400         | The request is invalid; correct all issues before resending. | | unauthorized         | 401         | A valid API key is required. | | forbidden            | 403         | Public API keys may only be used to create and retrieve hosted cards. | | notFound             | 404         | The requested resource does not exist. | | methodNotAllowed     | 405         | The given method may not be used here. Note that the X-HTTP-Method-Override header can only be used to override POST with either PATCH or DELETE | | notAcceptable        | 406         | The Accept request header must specify 'application/json;charset=UTF-8'; the Accept-Version request header if present, must reference a valid API version. | | conflict             | 409         | This request does not match the original, or the original request is still processing. | | lengthRequired       | 411         | Content-Length must be specified for this request. | | payloadTooLarge      | 413         | The request payload is too large. | | unsupportedMediaType | 415         | The Content-Type request header must specify 'application/json'| | tooManyRequests      | 429         | Too many requests have been received too quickly for this API key. |  5xx status codes show an unexpected server problem. Elavon Payment Gateway may be unable to return a standard error response for these.  ## Versioning  The current version is \"1\" and future versions will always be integral numbers. The client should specify which version they want using an \"Accept-Version\" request header. If not specified, Elavon Payment Gateway will assume the current version, but the response will include a \"Warning\" response header. The response will always include a \"Version\" header to show the version used. Example:  ``` Accept-Version: 1 ```  Elavon will avoid releasing versions with breaking changes. We will release some backwards compatible fixes without revising the version. If you are integrating with Elavon Payment Gateway, keep an eye out for some of the following changes:  * New resources * New optional request query parameters and/or headers * New optional fields (Elavon may generate these randomly to ensure compliance) * Field order changes (while generally consistent, you should consider the order undefined) * New values for enumerated fields * New HTTP error codes * Changes to the format of IDs  ## Pagination  When listing resources, the API returns a standard PagedList. This resource includes links to the first and next pages in the list. If next page is null, then there are no more items. The default number of items for a page may vary by resource. To override the default, use the \"limit\" query parameter. By default, the limit is 10. The maximum limit for a pagination object is 200 entries. The \"items\" array contains the resources for the page.  See the example in Collection Filtering, where the filter \"limit=2\" indicates a limit of 2.  ## Collection Filtering  Certain resources have the option to apply filters. To specify a filter, provide one or more query parameters where the name starts with \"filter\" and the value is \"fieldName_operator_value\". Check the [operations](#section/Overview/Operations) to see which fields support filtering and what operators each field supports. When using more than one filter, the resource must match every one of them.  Possible operators include: * eq (equals) * ne (not equals) * gt (greater than) * ge (greater than or equal) * lt (less than) * le (less than or equal)  When filtering a field of type \"URL resource\", the value should be an ID (e.g. 6xxFwvM8BqmM6T6DcF3DyTB3).  When filtering a field of type \"timestamp string\", format the value as an [RFC3339 Date/Time](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/html/rfc3339.html#anchor14) in the UTC time zone. The date/time separators, time section, seconds, milliseconds and Zulu time zone designator are all optional.  Example:  ```sh curl -X GET \\   \"https://api.eu.convergepay.com/transactions?filter=type_eq_refund&filter=createdAt_gt_2020&limit=2\" \\   -u 963myjmWbtt2DQgVpGyxcdW9:sk_GWhvCdXCx6FWYhDqCRWVwtRk \\   -H 'Accept-Version: 4' \\ ```  The previous example lists transactions via GET {endpoint}/transactions to retrieve all transactions created after the start of 2020.  The following sections support filters:  * [Retrieve Payment Links](#operation/RetrievePaymentLinks) * [Retrieve Payment Session](#operation/RetrievePaymentSession) * [Retrieve Transactions](#operation/RetrieveTransactions) * [Retrieve Notifications](#operation/RetrieveNotifications)  ## Values  **Resource ID**  <!-- Is this really necessary? Any updates to resource ID's like this should probably result in a version update and list the changes in the change log. -->  A unique string assigned as an identifier to individual resources. Each resource ID omits vowels to avoid confusing characters (O vs 0, for example). Treat Resource IDs as opaque strings with a 256 character limit when storing them.  **Resource URL**  A URL to an endpoint that will respond with the contents of an individual resource instance. Under each resource, a dropdown menu displays the available endpoints.  **Timestamps**  Timestamps use [RFC3339 Date/Time](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/html/rfc3339.html#anchor14) format with the UTC time zone (e.g. \"2018-02-01T05:10:20.152Z\").  **Currency**  Elavon Payment Gateway represents currency amounts as strings using the natural or base units of the currency. A period is the decimal separator when the value needs one (e.g. 99,95â‚¬ would be \"99.95\").  ## Custom Reference / Custom Fields  Some resources accept integrator defined arbitrary custom fields. Elavon Payment Gateway does not use these fields for any operations; The API stores these fields with the associated resource and returns them when you request the resource.  Custom field names and values must not exceed 64 and 1024 characters, respectively.  <!-- Do we need to declare this? If we are going to delete data due to somebody storing too much of this, that needs to be included in EULA or we should preset that limit and provide an error when people go over it -->  <!-- What does this mean? -->  As integrators have their own resources, these should be identified on the integrator side and only optionally provided to Elavon for cross-referencing purposes.  ## Operations  Each resource will have an ID that identifies it within a resource collection.  Elavon Payment Gateway uses commonly accepted HTTP methods to perform standard CRUD operations on resources (where allowed) using consistent resource paths.  | Operation | HTTP Request                      | Successful Status Code | |-----------|-----------------------------------|------------------------| | Create    | POST {resource-collection}        | 201 Created            | | Retrieve  | GET {resource-collection}/{id}    | 200 OK                 | | Retrieve  | GET {resource-collection}         | 200 OK                 | | Update    | POST {resource-collection}/{id}   | 200 OK                 | | Delete    | DELETE {resource-collection}/{id} | 204 No Content         |  Create operations will return the created resource.  ### HTTP Success vs. Transaction Success  Note that when creating and authorizing a transaction, Elavon Payment Gateway returns a 201 to show the transaction request processed, even if the transaction itself was declined. When creating transactions, use the `state` property of the Transaction to check whether Elavon Payment Gateway authorized or declined the transaction. If the transaction declined, the `failures` property provides an array of causes.  ### Deleting Resources  If the DELETE method is not allowed from the client, make a POST request instead with the optional request header \"X-HTTP-Method-Override: DELETE\".  The request for an update operation should only include those fields that have changed. To remove a field set its value to null.  ### CORS  **Only** hosted card operations support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requests from a browser. Initiate all   other operations from a secure server.  | Resources            | Create                                           | Retrieve                                          | Update
